	<h3>Acts 7 </h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup id="en-NIV-27136">30</sup>"After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. <sup id="en-NIV-27137">31</sup>When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord's voice: <sup id="en-NIV-27138">32</sup>'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.'<sup>[<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%207&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-27138e" title="See footnote e">e</a>]</sup> Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup id="en-NIV-27139">33</sup>"Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off your sandals; the place where you are standing is holy ground. <sup id="en-NIV-27140">34</sup>I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.'<sup>[<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%207&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-27140f" title="See footnote f">f</a>]</sup> </p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup id="en-NIV-27141">35</sup>"This is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words, 'Who made you ruler and judge?' He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. <sup id="en-NIV-27142">36</sup>He led them out of Egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea<sup>[<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%207&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-27142g" title="See footnote g">g</a>]</sup> and for forty years in the desert. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup id="en-NIV-27143">37</sup>"This is that Moses who told the Israelites, 'God will send you a prophet like me from your own people.'<sup>[<a href="http://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%207&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-27143h" title="See footnote h">h</a>]</sup> <sup id="en-NIV-27144">38</sup>He was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to us. </p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup id="en-NIV-27145">39</sup>"But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. </p>
	<p>...</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup id="en-NIV-27157">51</sup>"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! <sup id="en-NIV-27158">52</sup>Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him&mdash; <sup id="en-NIV-27159">53</sup>you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it." </p>
	<h3>Tertullian (c. 200 C.E.): </h3>
	<p>"This among Christians is a <em>season of </em>persecution. When, therefore, faith is greatly agitated, and the Church burning, as represented by the bush, then the Gnostics break out, then the Valentinians creep forth, then all the opponents of martyrdom bubble up, being themselves also hot to strike, penetrate, kill."</p>
